You can check the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1469786151785164722) used for these components and use it for your own projects. Designs are under the _CC BY-SA 4.0 license_.

This work was possible thanks to Frontend Masters courses, namely:

- [Figma for Developers v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/figma-v2/)
- [Design Systems with Storybook v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/design-systems-v2/)

Both courses are taught by the GOAT itself [Steve Kinney](https://stevekinney.net/), whose courses notes you can find [here](https://stevekinney.net/courses/storybook) and [here](https://stevekinney.net/courses/figma).

[Radix-ui primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/introduction) were used for most components.
Component implementations and API design was heavily inpired by the awesome work of [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
